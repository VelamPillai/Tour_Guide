 ## Kanyakumari

 Kanyakumari (US: /kənˈjʌkʊmɑːriː/); lit. "The Virgin Princess" (also known as Cape Comorin) is a town in Kanyakumari District in the state of Tamil Nadu in India. It is the southern tip of Indian subcontinent. The southernmost town in mainland India, it is sometimes referred to as 'The Land's End'.

A popular tourist destination in India, it is famous for its unique ocean sunrise, sunset and moonrise, the 41-metre (133 ft) Thiruvalluvar Statue and Vivekananda Rock Memorial off the coast, and as a pilgrimage centre.[1] Lying at the tip of peninsular India, Kanyakumari is bordered on the west, south and east by the Laccadive Sea.[2] It has a coastal line of 71.5 kilometres (44.4 mi) stretched on the three sides.[3]

## Vattakotai


 Vattakottai Fort (or 'Circular Fort') is a seaside fort near Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu the southern tip of India. It was built in the 18th century as a coastal defence-fortification and barracks in the erstwhile Travancore kingdom.

It was constructed in the 18th century by Punachal/Elakkara Valiyaveetil Marthandan Chempakaraman Pillai for the kings of Travancore. Marthanda Pillai was born in an aristocratic house in Punachal Elakkara near Kuzhikode near Palliyadi in Kanyakumari district. (Then South Travancore). The house was a house that was associated with the royal family. Marthanda Pillai was born in the month of May 903 in Bharani Nakshatra, the son of Neelamma Pillai, a member of the said house, and Iravikurup, the bodyguard of Marthanda Varma. Later it was modified under the supervision of Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, an ex-Dutch naval officer of the Dutch East India Company, who became commander of the Travancore Army (the very army that defeated him in the Battle of Colachel) in the 18th century, after he earned the trust of the Travancore King Marthanda Varma. De Lannoy reconstructed Vattakottai, as part of the defence-fortifications he undertook throughout Travancore.
